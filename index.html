        <h2>Who is he ?</h2>
        <p> <b>Berners-Lee </b>  is a British computer scientist best known for inventing the World Wide Web.
            In 1989, while working at CERN, he proposed a system to manage and share information via hypertext, which led to the development of the first web browser and web server.
            His invention revolutionized communication, information sharing, and access to knowledge, fundamentally changing the way people interact online. 
            Berners-Lee is also a strong advocate for internet standards and an open web, contributing significantly to the development of web protocols and standards through the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
